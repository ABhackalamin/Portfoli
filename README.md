## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### Requirements
- Any modern web browser (no server-side processing required for the HTML/CSS/JS version)
- Optional: PHP 7.4+ with Apache/Nginx for server-side extensions

### Installation

2. Place all files in your web server's root directory (or open `index.html` directly in a browser for local viewing).
3. Replace `assets/images/profile.jpg` with your own profile photo.
4. Replace `assets/cv.pdf` with your updated CV.
5. Edit the HTML files in each section folder to update your personal content.

### Customization

- **Styles:** Edit `assets/css/style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Scripts:** Edit `assets/js/script.js` for interactive behavior.
